# Nice to meet you! Let us tell you who we are

Founded in 2016 and previously with the name Rentadrone.cl we are a Chile based company that pioneered the use of drones to detect anomalies in solar panels in the Atacama Desert, the most amazing place for solar energy generation. Rentadrone was twice backed by [UNICEF Innovation Fund](https://www.unicefinnovationfund.org/broadcast/updates/uncief-innovation-fund-graduate-rentadrone) where we were capable to develop open-source software to improve our internal processes and become chilean market leaders in the photovoltaic industry among all its phases. Engineering, Construction and Operation.

## We have built a collection of best-in-class products:

- [Guidance for UAV Thermography](https://github.com/RentadroneCL/Guidance-of-UAV-Thermography): Involves careful consideration of factors such as the selection of the appropriate UAV, the type of thermographic camera, and the flight planning and data acquisition techniques.
- [Photovoltaic Fault Detector](https://github.com/RentadroneCL/Photovoltaic_Fault_Detector): deep learning application for fault detection in photovoltaic plants.
- [AI Agro](https://github.com/RentadroneCL/AI-Agro): Machine Learning Algorithms developed with the aim of determining health states of different types of crops.
- [Solar platform](https://github.com/RentadroneCL/AI-Solar-Platform): Production-ready reference implementation of an administration tool for your organization projects.

To learn all about it, head over to the extensive [documentation](https://rentadronecl.github.io).
